# riemann-divisor-sum-go

In this repo, we follow the footsteps of a master - [Jeremy Kunn](https://twitter.com/jeremyjkun) to learn software engineering principles by ironically trying to solve the Riemann Hypothesis!

This repo will closely follow the original repo [here](https://github.com/j2kun/riemann-divisor-sum), but in Golang instead of python.

All credits to the original author.

This readme will be updated once we have more content.
